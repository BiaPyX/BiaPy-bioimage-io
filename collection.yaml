  # Instance segmentation

    id: notebook_instance_segmentation_2d
    name: Instance Segmentation (2D) - BiaPy
    description: 2D Instance Segmentation workflow where the goal is to detect, segment, and classify the individual objects of interest in the input image. BiaPy uses a bottom-up approach in instance segmentation workflows by learning the binary masks, contours, and (optionally) the distance map of the objects of interest. There is no restriction in the type of images that can be used as long as they are 2D files.

  # Self-supervised learning
  - type: application
    id: notebook_self_supervision_2d
    name: Self_Supervision (2D) - BiaPy
    description: 2D Self Supervision workflow where the idea is to pretrain the backbone model by solving a so-called pretext task without labels. This way, the model learns a representation that can be later transferred to solve a downstream task in a labeled (but smaller) dataset. There is no restriction in the type of images that can be used as long as they are 2D files.
